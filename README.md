# CapstoneStudentApp
A repository that holds an express app to showcase coding front end and back end skills. This is my capstone project for mtec.

### Goal of the app demo: 

The goal of the app is to showcase what a simple course manager could look like. 

The "dnd" aspect is simply to showcase it's flexible and you can put anything you want on it. 

### Explanation of the tecnologies used: 

Express and React are obviously the core of the project. My project also relies heavily on JWT to verify users and give them the ability to log in. 

The biggest help in my opinion is MONGODB. Having a easy to work with database is incredibly fun and flexible.

### Explanation of the source code.

/* uhhh */

### What was your biggest coding hurdle? 

To me the biggest hurdle was understanding and applying passport. Which is meant to simplify your life, but part of me understood the long process of getting there more than just setting up passport. 

### What was your biggest coding accomplishment? 

Finally understanding how a full website really works. I dont think anythign I coded was specifically amazing. But I think the fact I understand how a normal website I visit can look like. That fills wiht confidence as a developer. 

### Experience overall? 

I had fun. I love coding. But in realiaty I am going through hard challenges in my life right now. Which was a great toll mentally.

The next biggest hurdle was working alone, I had many personal things come up in my life. So I would've hated to drag down someone with me. 

But even then I decided to attempt to finish and work on the project which I am extremely glad I did. 


### Will the project be finsihed by the deadline? 

I believe the project is a very good form, But it can be improved. 

Since I believe all that would need to be revised is some security checks and applying a better coat of pain over the css. I believe it could be ready for deployment whenever ready.

### How did you like it and why? 

Personally it was just fine, It wasn't my favorite project ever. But I am happy I did it. I feel like this is the most I'v worked out my brain in a while. 

### What would you do differently if you had the choice to start over? 

I would build a more comprehensive base. I had to rework so much of my base code when I saw a requirement I didnt account for. 

I would defenitly also attempt to work with a partner that has a better grasp of css. 

I do not understand what is **good** css. To me a nice and simple look is good but maybe a changin backgorund looks new and professional?
